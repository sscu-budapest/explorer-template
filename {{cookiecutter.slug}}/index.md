# Data Exploration Catalog

```{admonition} How this catalog works?
:class: dropdown
This site refreshes regularly and is intended to help researchers engage with a more diverse dataset collection. The main point is not reproducibility, but exploration. The tables usually update periodically, they can be downloaded in CSV format.

The diagram below presents the datasets contained in the catalog, with the tables within each dataset. You can see the basic explorative analysis of the tables by clicking on them.
